  <h1>Dreams and Aspirations</h1>
<p>My most important aspiration is being successful in the fashion area. Working on fashion, with designers and magazines, going to runway shows and working on marketing. Also, I dream of moving to Italy or Spain to study a career and work there. As well, I would love to travel all around the world, get to know a lot of people and cultures. </p>

<h1>Pets</h1>
<p>I have had 4 pets during my life. Before I was born, my parents had a dog called Martin, so I grew up with him. Then, when I was 7 years old, my parents got me another dog called Mia, but she got very sick and died very young. Later, I adopted a new dog called Luna and two months ago I got my own horse, Rufian. Nowadays, I have my horse and my dog Luna, because the dog I grew up with, passed away almost 3 months ago. </p>

<h1>Favorites</h1>

<h2>Artist</h2>
<p>My favorite artist is Bad Bunny. I think he is very talented, and in my opinion, he is one of the best artists in the reggaeton genre. I loved his last album, but some of his best songs are old ones.</p>

<h1>Story time</h1>
<p>The first time I went to a cruise I was 6 years old. I went with my mom, my dad and some other family friends. The day before I was very sick, so my parents were very worried, but the day of the cruise I got better. I loved the cruise and I had so much fun. In that same trip we went to Orlando. We went to Disney, and I remember it was October, so all the characters in the park were dressed up. My parents bought me a Rapunzel costume and a Rapunzel doll, and I spent all day dressed up as Rapunzel and with the doll. </p>

<h1>Reccomendations</h1>
<p>I recommend visiting Playa del Carmen in Mexico because it has the most beautiful beaches and the best resorts to rest, also the food is delicious. I also recommend visiting Las Vegas city, it is an amazing place to visit because it’s very interesting and entertaining. The hotels are amazing because each of them has different themes, the shops are giant and is amazing to walk around.
I recommend 3 TV shows, first Dynasty because is has a lot of drama and its funny and entertaining. Second, Gossip Girl because its very interesting and has love, drama, humor, etc. And finally, Outer Banks, it is very interesting, the story is very different from any other show and has action, love and its very engaging.
